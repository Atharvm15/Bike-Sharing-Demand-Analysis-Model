## Introduction:

Bike sharing systems have become increasingly popular in urban areas as a sustainable and convenient mode of transportation. These systems provide users with access to bicycles for short-term rentals, promoting eco-friendly commuting and reducing traffic congestion. Understanding the demand for bike sharing services is crucial for optimizing bike allocation, infrastructure planning, and enhancing user satisfaction. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model for bike sharing demand analysis. By leveraging historical data on bike rentals and relevant environmental factors, our model will predict the demand for bike rentals at different times and locations. This predictive analysis will empower bike sharing operators and urban planners to make informed decisions, improve system efficiency, and promote sustainable urban mobility. Through data-driven insights, we aspire to contribute to the development of smart and sustainable transportation solutions in urban environments.

## Project Objective:

The primary objective of our bike sharing demand analysis model is to accurately predict the demand for bike rentals at various times and locations within the city. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data on bike usage patterns, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, our model aims to provide actionable insights to bike sharing operators. Firstly, we seek to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting bike rental demand with high accuracy, considering temporal factors such as time of day, day of the week, and seasonal variations. Additionally, we aim to analyze spatial trends in bike rental demand to identify high-demand areas within the city, enabling operators to optimize bike allocation and distribution strategies. By evaluating the impact of weather conditions on bike rental demand, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, we aim to incorporate weather forecasts into demand predictions. Through feature engineering, we intend to identify and engineer relevant features from available data sources to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model and capture complex relationships between predictors and demand. To ensure robustness and reliability in real-world applications, we will assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). Finally, we plan to integrate the trained model into existing bike sharing systems or decision support tools used by operators for real-time demand forecasting and informed decision-making. Overall, our model aims to empower bike sharing operators with actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, enhance service reliability, and improve the overall user experience of bike sharing systems, contributing to the sustainability, efficiency, and accessibility of urban transportation networks.

- **Pandas Configuration:** This line of code sets a Pandas option to display a maximum of 999 columns. This configuration ensures that all columns are visible when examining large datasets, preventing truncation and allowing for comprehensive data exploration.

## Cell 2: Reading and Previewing the Dataset

In this cell, the dataset `hour.csv` is read into a Pandas DataFrame named `df` using the `read_csv()` function from the Pandas library. This dataset likely contains hourly bike rental data. After reading the dataset, the `head()` function is called on the DataFrame `df` to display the first few rows of the dataset. This provides a preview of the dataset's structure and allows users to inspect the column names, data types, and some sample values. By examining the first few rows, users can gain initial insights into the dataset's contents and determine how to proceed with data analysis and preprocessing tasks.


## Cell 3: DataFrame Analysis

This code snippet is designed to analyze the DataFrame `df` and provide various insights into its structure and content:

1. **Statistical Info:**
   - The `describe()` function generates summary statistics of the numerical columns in the DataFrame, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. This allows for a quick overview of the distribution and range of values within each numerical feature.

2. **Datatype Info:**
   - The `info()` function provides detailed information about the datatype of each column in the DataFrame, as well as the count of non-null values. This is useful for understanding the data types present in the DataFrame and identifying potential data type mismatches or missing values.

3. **Unique Values:**
   - Utilizing the `apply()` function along with a lambda expression, the code calculates the count of unique values in each column of the DataFrame. This can help identify categorical variables and assess the cardinality of each feature, which is important for feature engineering and preprocessing.

4. **Null Values Check:**
   - By applying the `isnull().sum()` function, the code computes the number of missing values (null values) in each column of the DataFrame. Identifying missing values is crucial for data cleaning and preprocessing, as it allows for informed decisions on how to handle or impute missing data.

These analytical steps provide valuable insights into the structure, content, and quality of the DataFrame, facilitating further data exploration and preprocessing efforts. 

## Cell 4: DataFrame Column Renaming and Data Type Conversion

This code snippet performs two main operations on the DataFrame `df`: renaming columns and converting data types.

1. **Column Renaming:**
   - The `rename()` function is used to rename specific columns in the DataFrame. Column names are changed according to the provided dictionary, where keys represent the old column names and values represent the new column names. This is useful for improving readability or aligning column names with a specific naming convention.

2. **Data Type Conversion:**
   - Certain columns in the DataFrame are converted to categorical data types using the `astype()` function. This is achieved by specifying a list of columns (`cols`) and iterating over each column to convert its data type to 'category'. Categorical data types are useful for columns with a limited number of unique values, as they can improve memory usage and computational efficiency.

3. **Dropping Columns:**
   - The `drop()` function is utilized to remove unnecessary columns from the DataFrame. Columns specified in the `columns` parameter are dropped from the DataFrame, reducing the dimensionality of the data and potentially improving computational performance.

4. **DataFrame Information:**
   - After the column renaming and data type conversion operations, the `info()` function is called to display information about the DataFrame. This includes the data types of each column, as well as the count of non-null values. It provides a summary of the DataFrame's structure and helps verify the success of the renaming and data type conversion processes.

By performing these operations, the code aims to enhance the clarity and efficiency of data manipulation and analysis tasks performed on the DataFrame.

## Cell 5: Visualization and Analysis of Bike Sharing Data

This code snippet generates various visualizations and conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on bike sharing data stored in the DataFrame `df`. The visualizations provide insights into the relationship between different factors such as time, weather conditions, and user counts.

1. **Hourly Trends:**
   - Multiple `sns.pointplot()` and `sns.barplot()` functions are used to visualize the hourly and monthly trends in bike usage. Plots are segmented by weekdays, weekends, and seasons to analyze how user counts vary throughout the day and across different months and seasons.

2. **User Types:**
   - Separate `sns.pointplot()` plots are created to distinguish between registered and unregistered (casual) users. This allows for the analysis of user behavior and preferences based on weekdays and weekends.

3. **Temperature and Humidity Impact:**
   - Regression plots (`sns.regplot()`) are generated to explore the relationship between temperature, humidity, and bike usage. These plots help understand how weather conditions influence user counts.

4. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - The distribution of user counts is visualized using `sns.distplot()`. Additionally, a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot (`qqplot()`) is generated to assess whether the distribution of user counts follows a normal distribution.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - A heatmap (`sns.heatmap()`) is created to visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset. This allows for the identification of correlations between different variables, providing insights into potential relationships between features.

By generating these visualizations and conducting EDA, the code aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the bike sharing dataset, facilitating further analysis and modeling tasks.

## Cell 6: One-Hot Encoding and Regression Modeling

This code snippet performs one-hot encoding on categorical variables in the DataFrame `df` and builds regression models to predict bike counts. The process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

1. **One-Hot Encoding:**
   - The function `one_hot_encoding()` is defined to perform one-hot encoding on categorical columns specified in the list `cols`. This function iterates over each column, applies one-hot encoding, and drops the original column from the dataset. The result is stored in the DataFrame `df_oh`.
   - The `pd.get_dummies()` function is used to perform one-hot encoding on the 'season' column, and the resulting DataFrame is stored in `df_oh`.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Columns like 'atemp', 'windspeed', 'casual', 'registered', and 'count' are dropped from the feature set `X` as they are either redundant or represent the target variable.
   - The target variable 'count' is stored in the variable `y`.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Various regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Huber Regressor, ElasticNetCV, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor are imported from `sklearn`.
   - The `train()` function is defined to train each model using k-fold cross-validation with 5 folds. Mean squared error (MSE) is used as the evaluation metric, and the cross-validated score (`cv_score`) is printed for each model.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.
   - A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.
   - The predicted values (`y_pred`) are compared with the actual values (`y_test`) to calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) using `mean_squared_error()` from `sklearn.metrics`.
   - A scatter plot of the observed values versus the error is generated to visualize the performance of the model.

By following these steps, the code aims to preprocess the data, train multiple regression models, and evaluate their performance to predict bike counts accurately.
